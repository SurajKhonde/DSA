# Backend Notes

As a <mark style="color:orange;">**JavaScript developer**</mark>, I prefer to write server-side code using JavaScript. There are numerous options available, but I always gravitate towards JavaScript-based solutions. This language serves as the foundation of my development approach, offering a familiar and consistent environment across both front-end and back-end tasks. While there are various tools and frameworks to choose from, I prioritize those that align with my expertise and comfort level in JavaScript. This ensures a seamless transition between different aspects of a project and allows me to leverage my skills effectively.

let's delve into <mark style="color:red;">**Express.js**</mark>! Express.js, built on top of Node.js, serves as a powerful web application framework, facilitating the development of server-side APIs with remarkable ease. While Node.js forms the backbone of our runtime environment, Express.js empowers us to swiftly craft robust APIs that seamlessly handle requests and responses.

Express.js shines in its ability to streamline the creation of server-side routes, effortlessly managing the flow of data between clients and servers. With its intuitive syntax and flexible architecture, Express.js enables us to focus on crafting efficient APIs without delving too deeply into the intricacies of Node.js.

So, let's embark on this journey with Express.js, leveraging its simplicity and versatility to create dynamic and responsive server-side APIs. Let's harness its power to build scalable and performant backend solutions that cater to the diverse needs of our applications.

With Express.js, you can quickly set up routes to handle different <mark style="color:orange;">**HTTP requests**</mark> (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), parse **incoming request bodies**, handle cookies, and much more. It's lightweight, unopinionated, and allows developers to structure their applications in a way that best suits their needs.



```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;
// Define a route to handle GET requests
app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
    // Logic to fetch users from the database
    const users = [
        { id: 1, name: 'John' },
        { id: 2, name: 'Jane' },
        { id: 3, name: 'Doe' }
    ];
    res.send(users);
    }
    app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

```javascript
//without any worry you can import like 
const express = require('express');
```

```javascript
// Define a route to handle POST requests
app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
    // Logic to create a new user
    res.send('User created successfully');
});

// Define a route to handle PUT requests
app.put('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
    // Logic to update a user with the specified ID
    res.send(`User with ID ${req.params.id} updated successfully`);
});

// Define a route to handle DELETE requests
app.delete('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
    // Logic to delete a user with the specified ID
    res.send(`User with ID ${req.params.id} deleted successfully`);
});
```

If you want to import like normal React in <mark style="color:orange;">**Package.json**</mark>

```json
 "main": "Index.js",
  "type": "module",//this is very important  to write like this for 
```
